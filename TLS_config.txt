######
#
# For lightkurve.flatten()
# Parameters to tune light curve filter properties:
#
# [window_length] (positive, odd int) The length of the Savitzky-Golay filter 
# window (i.e. the number of coefficients). 
#
# [polyorder] (int) The order of the polynomial used to fit the samples. 
# polyorder must be less than window_length.
#
######
#
# For lightkurve.remove_outliers()
# Parameters to eliminate light curve outliers:
#
# [sigma_lower] (int, default: 5) Number of std deviations to use as lower bound
# for clipping limit. Can be set to float(‘inf’) in order to avoid clipping 
# any outliers below the median.
#
# [sigma_upper] (int, default: 5) Number of std deviations to use as upper bound
# clipping limit. Can be set to float(‘inf’) in order to avoid clipping 
# any outliers above the median.
#
######
#
# General parameters:
#
# [planets_per_system] (int, 1 to 4) Limit on number of planet candidates 
# analyzed for each host star system.
#
######
#
# For lowess filter
# Parameters for smoothing lines for light curves:
#
# [lowess_frac_prim] (float, ~ 0 to <1)  The fraction of the data used when 
# estimating each y-value. Key parameter for lowess filter (very similar to 
# Savitsky-Golay filter).  This is for the primary transit.
#
# [flux_lim_prim] (float, ~ 0 to <1) Cutoff threshold to force out-of transit 
# data to 1.0. This is for the primary transit.
#
# [lowess_frac_sec] (float, ~ 0.95 to < 1.0)  The fraction of the data used when 
# estimating each y-value (similar to SG window). This is for the secondary eclipse.
#
# [flux_lim_sec] (float, ~ 0.95 to < 1.0) Cutoff threshold to force out of transit 
# data to 1.0. This is for the secondary eclipse.
#
######
#
# For transitleastsquares.power()
# Parameters to balance detection efficiency and computational requirements:
#
# [oversampling_factor] (int, default: 3) Oversampling of the period grid to 
# avoid that the true period falls in between trial periods and is missed.  
# Note: Higher oversampling_factor increases the detection efficiency at the 
# cost of a linear increase in computational effort. Reasonable values may be 
# 2-5 and should be tested empirically for the actual data. An upper limit can
# be found when the period step is smaller than the cadence, so that the error
# from shifting the model by one data point in phase dominates over the period 
# trial shift. For a planet with a 365-day period orbiting a solar mass and 
# radius star, this parity is reached for oversampling_factor=9 at 30 min 
# cadence (Kepler LC). Shorter periods have reduced oversampling benefits, as 
# the cadence becomes a larger fraction of the period.
# 
# [duration_grid_step] (float, default: 1.1) Grid step width between subsequent 
# trial durations, so that dur𝑛+1 = dur𝑛 × duration_grid_step. With the default
# value of 1.1, each subsequent trial duration is longer by 10%.
# 
# [transit_depth_min] (float, default: 10e^-6) Shallowest transit depth to be 
# fitted. Transit depths down to half the transit_depth_min can be found at 
# reduced sensitivity. A reasonable value should be estimated from the data to
# balance sensitivity and avoid fitting the noise floor. Overfitting may cause
# computational requirements larger by a factor of 10. For reference, the 
# shallowest known transit is 11.9 ppm (Kepler-37b, Barclay et al. 2013)

# All other parameters are set to default (see TLS Documentation)
